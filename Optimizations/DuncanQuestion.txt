LOGGER = logging.getLogger("Platypus")
returns a Logger (WARNING) Object

I see that all throughout the Platypus pip installed library, the "Platypus" logger is written to with some important
algorithm information. I want to access the file location of the logger, but nowhere in the platypus-opt directories
is logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', encoding='utf-8', level=logging.DEBUG) called to set that file location

Q: Do I have to run this ^ somewhere or is the log location in the directories
