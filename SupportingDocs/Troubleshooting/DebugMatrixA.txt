This is an explanation of the file DebugMatrixA.jpg:

The blue and red grid lines segment the visualization of matrix A.
	Every horizontal blue line signifies a new set of equations in a new region. Note: The colour of the squares change with a change in region.
	Every vertical blue line signifies a new set of unkown coefficients (for a new region) that will be multiplied to the unknown variables in matrix X.

	The red grid lines split up the MEC region in the horizontal and vertical direction for the boundary equations between MEC and HM.
	Between the red and blue grid lines is equal to grid.ppL equations (rows) and grid.ppL unknown coefficients (columns).
	
The first and last region in the vertical direction are half the length of the other fourier regions.
	This is because half of the unknown coefficients were removed in the Dirichlet equations since it is a noon-continuous boundary.
	In the first region, the bn unknown coefficients were removed.
	In the second region, the an unknown coefficients were removed.

The first and last region in the horizontal direction were deleted Dirichlet equations since the equations contained infinity at the y = (+-infinity).
	Now there remains N equations at the top HM-MEC boundary (region 0 to 1) and 2N equations at the bottom HM-HM boundary (region 4 to 5).
